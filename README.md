# Code Snippet:

Here's a sample Python code snippet for a smart contract using the Pi Network blockchain:

```python

1. import pi_blockchain as pi
2. 
3. class MedicalDataSmartContract:
4.    def __init__(self):
5.        self.contract_id = pi.create_contract()
6. 
7.   def add_data(self, patient_id, data_hash):
8.        pi.execute_contract(self.contract_id, {
9.            'function': 'add_data',
10.            'patient_id': patient_id,
11.            'data_hash': data_hash
12.        })
13. 
14.    def get_data_hash(self, patient_id):
15.        result = pi.execute_contract(self.contract_id, {
16.            'function': 'get_data_hash',
17.            'patient_id': patient_id
18.        })
19.       return result['data_hash']
20. 
21. medical_data_contract = MedicalDataSmartContract()
22. medical_data_contract.add_data('123456', 'abcdef123456')
23. data_hash = medical_data_contract.get_data_hash('123456')
24. print(f'Data hash for patient 123456: {data_hash}')

```

This code snippet demonstrates a simple smart contract for managing medical data using the Pi Network blockchain. The MedicalDataSmartContract class initializes a new smart contract and provides methods for adding data and retrieving data hashes. The data itself is stored off-chain, and only the hash is stored on the blockchain for security and privacy reasons.
